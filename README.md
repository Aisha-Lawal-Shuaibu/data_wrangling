Data wrangling data using Twitter dataset

We have three steps in the data wrangling process. Namely; Data Gathering, Data Accessing and Data Cleaning. We have completed these 3 steps, now we have to draw insights from the clean data presented and also so some visualization. We made 3 insights and visualization on the clean data, regarding the ratings, the names and the breed of the dogs
Insights:
1. From the analysis we notice that 10,11,and 12 are the highest dog ratings
2. From the analysis we notice that while most dog names are missing(’None’), some dogs still share the same names. The most common are Tuker, Oliver, Penny, cooper and charlie
3. From the analysis we notice that while most dog breeds were missing, however the most common dog breeds are golden_retriever and labrador_retriever
Visualizations:
These are shown in the ipnyb file
